## Welcome to the best tasting spagetti code ever.
## It's really weird but I love shell script now! It's like cuddling a bl√•haj :3
## You need one package to run this, zip.
## Install zip by doing the "thing", in my case it's "sudo pacman -S zip".
## If you needed my help installing zip then you should (probably) not be here.
## as this is a DEV script for making zip files with .minecraft
## btw the only thing that takes time is zip compressing the file lol.



                       ##To disable zip when testing the script.

if ! $testing_mode; then
    echo "NOTE: Test mode is active: zip won't be used which means no compiled zip."
