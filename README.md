## About the modpack
This modpack uses [neoforged](https://neoforged.net/) with a few optimization mods and create. It is made with default [create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) so no addons and also has [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) to organize recipies. 

## Requirements for installation
This modpack is intended to be used with [neoforged](https://neoforged.net/). All you really need to do is copy the mods folder, config folder (and If you want to, the resource packs and shaders in their respective folders) in to the minecraft folder. The easiest way to get the folders is by going to [my github repo]([https://github.com/bloodclover/Create-Modpack/releases](https://github.com/bloodclover/Create-Modpack/releases/latest)) and downloading the latest dot-minecraft.zip file.

## Note
**This is my first modpack** and I am not great at maintaining things either, but it will probably update once in a while. If you are using prismlauncher or smth like that remember to redownload the pack after a new release, thank you.
