## About the modpack
This modpack uses [neoforged](https://neoforged.net/) with a few optimization mods and create. It is made with default [create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) so no addons and also has [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) to organize recipies. 

## Requirements for installation
This modpack is intended to be used with [neoforged](https://neoforged.net/). All you really need to do is copy the mods folder (and the resourepacks if you want) in to the minecraft folder.

## Note
**This is my first modpack** and I am not great at maintaining things either, but it will probably update once in a while.
